## About
This project was created as part of Udacity's [React Nanodegree][rnd] program. It's the third and final project from the program and focuses on the use of [React Native][native]. The base application was generated by `create-react-native-app`. The application was tested and developed primarily using iOS but should also run on Android as well.

The app relies on a number of projects:
  [Expo][ex] - Provides a number of features, it's biggest contribution is enhancing debugging experience.
  [React Native Elements][rne] - Used to improve the UI of the application.
  [React Navigation][rn] - Provides platform specific navigation for the app.
  [Redux][dux] - State management is handled with Redux.
  [Redux Thunk][thu] - A Redux middleware, is used to dispatch call to AsyncStorage.
